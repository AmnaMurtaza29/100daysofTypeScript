Day-76 Task: Read and understand the following Visual Guide about DNS and DHCP. 



DNS in One Picture 

Here's what I learned reading this article:

📚 Basic Understanding: DNS (Domain Name System) is important for developers to understand.

📖 Definition: DNS acts like a phonebook, translating domain names into IP addresses.

📱 Analogy: Just like using a contact's name to find their number in your phone, DNS uses domain names to find website IP addresses.

🌐 Function: Browsers need IP addresses to open websites, which they obtain through DNS.
