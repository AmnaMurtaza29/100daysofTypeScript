DHCP in One Picture [ https://lnkd.in/eA_7-sdr ]

Here's what I learned from reading this article:



DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is like a helpful organizer for computer networks. It hands out IP addresses and other essential network settings so devices can easily connect and communicate. Instead of needing manual setup for each device, DHCP automatically assigns them what they need when they join the network. It's like getting a key to a room in a hotel â€“ you don't have to know the room number beforehand; DHCP takes care of it for you.
