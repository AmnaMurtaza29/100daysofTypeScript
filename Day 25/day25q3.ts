//Question 75: Compound Assignment Operators: Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using compound operators.
function useCompoundOperators() {
    let x = 8; 
    console.log("Initial x:", x);

    x += 2; 
    console.log("After addition:", x);

    x -= 1; 
    console.log("After subtraction:", x); 

    x *= 3; 
    console.log("After multiplication:", x); 

    x /= 2; 
    console.log("After division:", x);
